Locks

![](http://img.tomato530.com/interfaceLocks.png)

上锁操作

```java
Lock l = ...;
 l.lock();
 try {
   // access the resource protected by this lock
 } finally {
   l.unlock();
 }
```

上锁在try外面 解锁在finally里

**线程的状态** 看源码

java.lang.Thread.State

```java

         * state is executing in the Java virtual machine but it may
         * be waiting for other resources from the operating system
         * such as processor.
         */
        RUNNABLE,

        /**
